# What is Syndicate?

Syndicate is a next-generation accelerator built for Gen-Z founders building in AI x Web3.  

We exist to give early builders **momentum, distribution, and a clean path to launch** — without equity, slow cycles, or gatekeeping.

Traditional accelerators were built for a different era. Syndicate is built for _ours_:

- Speed over bureaucracy  

- Execution over theory  

- Real users over vanity metrics  

- Founder-led culture over corporate politics  

If you’re a builder who can ship, Syndicate is the environment where you accelerate fast, find your first believers, and scale without losing control of your company.
