# Core Principles

These are the ideas Syndicate runs on — the mindset we expect from founders and hold ourselves accountable to.

## 1. Ship Fast

Speed beats everything.

A feature in users’ hands is worth more than a perfect idea in your head.

## 2. Be Authentic

No fake hype. No misleading claims.

The community appreciates builders who keep it real.

## 3. Execution \> Optics

We don’t reward fancy decks or long explanations.

We reward progress, iteration, and clarity.

## 4. Protect Your Users

Token holders and early believers matter.

Your decisions should prioritize long-term trust, not day-1 speculation.

## 5. Move With Intention

Everything you launch sets a tone.

Your messaging, your roadmap, your token mechanics — they all matter.

## 6. Momentum Is Earned

Syndicate amplifies you, but you must show signs of life.

Momentum compounds when founders are visible, transparent, and active.

## 7. Build for the Long-Term

We don’t accelerate pump-and-dump projects.

We accelerate founders who want to build actual products.

These principles guide every decision, conversation, and launch inside Syndicate.
